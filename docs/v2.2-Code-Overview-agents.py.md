## Code Overview

### What?

An advanced agent creation factory for generating specialized AI agents with configurable tools, callbacks, and error handling. Provides methods to create agents with specific roles and objectives.

---

### How?

1. The `AgentFactory` class is defined with a constructor that accepts an instance of `LLM` and an optional `SerperDevTool` for search functionality.
2. The `create_agent()` method is called with a string argument representing the agent role (`"researcher"`, `"writer"`, or `"illustrator"`).
3. Based on the agent role, the appropriate agent type is created using the `create_researcher_agent()`, `create_writer_agent()`, or `create_illustrator_agent()` methods.
4. The created agent is returned to the caller.

#### Key Features

* Uses a flexible `create_agent()` method with comprehensive configuration
* Supports tool wrapping with optional callback functionality
* Implements specialized agent creation methods for researcher, writer, and illustrator roles

---

### Coupling and Cohesion

* High cohesion within the factory
* Moderate coupling with external dependencies (LLM, SerperDevTool)
* Flexible design allows easy agent customization

---

### Single Responsibility Principle

The factory follows the SRP well, with separate methods for:

* `_wrap_tools()`: Tool transformation
* `create_agent()`: Generic agent creation
* Specialized methods for specific agent types

---

### Unusual Things

* Dynamic tool wrapping with callback mechanism
* Hardcoded verbose and cache settings
* Opinionated agent backstories and roles

---

### Highly Suspicious

* Potential performance overhead with tool wrapping
* Assumes `_tool_callback` is always safe to execute
* Raises exception if search tool not configured for researcher agent

---

### Future Work

* Add more agent types and roles
* Optimize tool wrapping for performance
* Consider refactoring for better modularity and testability
