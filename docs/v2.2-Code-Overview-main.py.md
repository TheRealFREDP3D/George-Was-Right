# George-Was-Right - /src/main.py

## Code Overview

This Python script is the main entry point for a CrewAI-based research and content generation application. It uses a modular, object-oriented approach to configure and execute an AI-powered workflow involving multiple specialized agents (researcher, writer, and illustrator) to perform a complex task.

### Key Components

#### CrewBuilder Class

Responsible for constructing and configuring the AI crew

* Manages agent initialization and task creation
* Uses a factory pattern for agent creation
* Builds a CrewAI crew with configurable settings

---

### Main Workflow

* Validates configuration settings
* Initializes agents using AgentFactory
* Creates tasks using TaskManager
* Builds and executes a CrewAI crew
* Handles logging and error management

---

### Key Features

* Utilizes CrewAI framework for multi-agent collaboration
* Integrates with external search tool (SerperDevTool)
* Configurable through a Settings class
* Supports dynamic agent and task creation
* Implements robust error handling and logging

---

### Execution Flow

1. Validate configuration
2. Initialize agents
3. Create tasks
4. Build crew
5. Execute crew workflow
6. Log and display results

---

The script is part of a flexible, AI-driven content generation system that can adapt to different research and creation tasks through its modular design.
