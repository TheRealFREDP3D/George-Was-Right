## Code Overview

### What?

A task manager initialization method that takes a dictionary of agents, storing them as an instance attribute for later use in task creation and management.

### How?

#### Key Features

* Accepts a dictionary of agents with roles as keys
* Stores the agents dictionary as an instance attribute
* Provides a simple mechanism for agent management

### Coupling and Cohesion

* Low coupling with external systems
* High cohesion within task management context
* Direct dependency on Agent objects

### Single Responsibility Principle

The method follows the SRP well, with a:

* Single purpose of initializing task manager with agents
* Clear, focused method signature
* No additional logic beyond agent storage

### Unusual Things

* Uses dictionary for agent storage
* Assumes agents are pre-configured before initialization

### Highly Suspicious

# TODO: FIX THIS

* No validation of agent dictionary
* Potential for silent failures if invalid agents are passed
* No type checking or agent role verification
