The `main.py` file contains the core application logic for setting up and executing tasks with the CrewAI system. Here's a breakdown of its structure and components:

### Main Execution Flow

The `main()` function orchestrates the initialization and execution of various components of the application.

<!-- file: f:\BACKUP\FRED\PROJECTS\_GITHUB-TheRealFredP3D\George-Was-Right\_PUBLIC-REPO\main.py -->
```python
def main():
    """Main execution flow."""
    try:
        # Initialize core components
        config = Config()
        llm = LLM(model=config.llm_model)
        search_tool = SerperDevTool(
            n_results=config.search_results, country=config.country
        )
        agent_factory = AgentFactory(llm)

        # Create agents
        agents = {
            "researcher": agent_factory.create_researcher_agent(),
            "writer": agent_factory.create_writer_agent(),
            "illustrator": agent_factory.create_illustrator_agent(),
        }

        # Create and execute crew
        task_manager = TaskManager(agents)
        tasks = task_manager.create_tasks()
        crew = Crew(
            agents=list(agents.values()),
            tasks=tasks,
            verbose=True,
            llm=config.llm_model,
            planning=True,
            planning_llm=config.llm_model,
        )
```

### Task Creation

Tasks are generated by the `TaskManager` and assigned to specific agents. Here's an example of task creation:

```python
def create_tasks(self) -> List[Task]:
    """Creates a list of tasks for the crew to execute."""
    return [
        Task(
            description="""Research and analyze current (2024) global surveillance practices, digital privacy concerns, 
            and social control mechanisms. Focus on:
            1. Government surveillance programs and data collection
            2. Social media monitoring and censorship
            3. Digital privacy breaches and corporate data harvesting
            4. State-sponsored misinformation campaigns
            Provide specific examples with verifiable sources and URLs.""",
            agent=self.agents["researcher"],
            expected_output="Detailed report of the recent cases with source URLs and key parallels to '1984' themes",
        ),
        Task(
            description="""Write a compelling 700-1000 word analysis that:
```

### Crew Execution

The `Crew` class is responsible for orchestrating the execution of the tasks by the agents.

```python
# Execute crew and save results
result = crew.kickoff()
print(f"""Analysis completed successfully using {config.llm_model}

***************************************************************************

{result}

***************************************************************************
""")
```

The script attempts to manage exceptions and print informative error messages:

```python
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

### Entry Point

The script's entry point is defined for when it's executed directly:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This file essentially manages the configuration, creation, and execution of agents and tasks within the CrewAI system. Together with the GUI, it facilitates a task-oriented approach for analyzing and reporting on surveillance and privacy issues.
