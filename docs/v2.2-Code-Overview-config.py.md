# George-Was-Right - /src/config.py

## Code Overview

### What?

A centralized configuration management class that handles application settings, API keys, and dynamic language model configuration with robust error handling and environment variable support.

---

### How?

#### Key Features

* Uses class methods and environment variables for configuration
* Provides methods for LLM configuration and settings validation
* Supports fallback mechanisms and default values

---

### Coupling and Cohesion

* High cohesion within configuration management
* Low coupling with external systems
* Flexible configuration through environment variables

---

### Single Responsibility Principle

The class follows the SRP well, with separate methods and attributes for:

* `get_llm()`: LLM configuration
* `validate()`: Configuration validation
* Class attributes for different configuration types

---

### Unusual Things

* Hardcoded fallback model name
* Timestamp generation at class level
* Mixing of configuration and validation logic

---

### Highly Suspicious

* Potential security risk with direct environment variable exposure
* Hardcoded base URL for LLM
* No mechanism for runtime configuration updates

---

### Things That Could Be Improved

* Environment variable validation
* Error handling for configuration validation
