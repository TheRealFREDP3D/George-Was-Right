The novel depicts a totalitarian society where the government exercises complete control over its citizens, suppressing any form of dissent or rebellion. In recent years, the novel has seen a resurgence in popularity, with many drawing parallels between the themes and events of the novel and the current state of the world.

One news event that has gained significant attention in recent times is "George Orwell's 1984 could happen in 2024, warns Microsoft president."
