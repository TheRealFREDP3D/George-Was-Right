Here are two sets of illustration prompts: one for the news event and one for the '1984' theme.

**News Event Illustration Prompts:**

1. A futuristic cityscape with skyscrapers made of screens displaying targeted advertisements, surrounded by surveillance cameras and drones, symbolizing the pervasive collection and exploitation of personal data.
2. A person trapped in a web of data streams, with social media platforms and online services siphoning their personal information, highlighting the risks of surveillance capitalism.
3. A split-screen illustration comparing a person's online persona with their real-life identity, showcasing the disparity between the two and the manipulation of information.

**'1984' Theme Illustration Prompts:**

1. A depiction of Big Brother's all-seeing eye, replaced with a smartphone or computer screen, emphasizing the government's surveillance capabilities in the digital age.
2. A cityscape with propaganda posters and banners, replaced with social media influencers and targeted advertisements, highlighting the manipulation of information and control of public opinion.
3. A person standing in front of a giant TV screen displaying a fabricated reality, symbolizing the erosion of individual autonomy and the control of reality.

These illustration prompts aim to visualize the parallels between the themes of '1984' and the current news events surrounding surveillance capitalism, misinformation, and government surveillance.
