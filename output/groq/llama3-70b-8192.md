Here are the two sets of illustration prompts:

**News Event Prompts:**

1. A city street with surveillance cameras installed on every corner, monitoring the movements of citizens, with a subtle hint of facial recognition technology in the background.
2. A social media platform with algorithms prioritizing sensationalized news and disinformation, spreading rapidly and insidiously.
3. A data collection center with rows of computers storing personal information, surrounded by authorities monitoring and controlling the flow of data.
4. A government official speaking at a podium, disseminating information to the public, with subtle hints of manipulation and distortion of facts.

**1984 Theme Prompts:**

1. A telescreen in a private home, monitoring the every move of a citizen, with Big Brother's face looming in the background.
2. The Ministry of Truth building, with propaganda posters and newspapers filled with manipulated information, surrounded by statues of Big Brother.
3. A group of citizens gathered around a telescreen, watching a government-controlled broadcast, with subtle hints of brainwashing and control.
4. A citizen attempting to rebel against the totalitarian government, with a subtle hint of surveillance and control in the background, symbolizing the all-seeing eye of Big Brother.

These illustration prompts aim to highlight the striking parallels between Orwell's 1984 and our modern world, emphasizing the themes of surveillance, propaganda, and government control.
