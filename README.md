Here is a README.md file for your project:

**Orwell's 1984 Research Project**
=================================

**Overview**
------------

This project uses CrewAI to analyze current events in relation to themes from George Orwell's "1984". It orchestrate three agents (Researcher, Writer, Illustrator) to perform tasks such as searching for relevant news, comparing news with "1984" themes, writing articles, and generating illustration prompts.

**Prerequisites**
---------------

* Python 3.8 or later
* crewai and crewai-tools libraries
* SerperDevTool API key (add to .env file)
* LLM model API key (add to .env file or set as environment variable)

**Usage**
------

1. Install required libraries: `pip install dotenv rich crewai crewai-tools`
2. Create a `.env` file with the necessary API keys:
```
SERPER_DEV_TOOL_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
LLM_MODEL_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```
3. Run the script: `python main.py`

**Output**
------

The script will generate a markdown file in the `output` directory with the results of the analysis.

**Configuration**
---------------

You can configure the script by modifying the following constants:

* `HOW_MANY_RESULTS`: The number of search results to retrieve.
* `COUNTRY`: The country to focus on for the search.
* `LLM_MODEL`: The large language model to use.

**Known Issues**
--------------

* Error handling could be improved.
* The script relies on a specific LLM model, which may change or become unavailable.
* The output file path is hardcoded; consider making it more flexible.

**Future Development**
--------------------

* Add more robust error handling and logging.
* Improve prompt engineering for better results.
* Allow for more flexible LLM model selection.
* Enhance output formatting and visualization.
