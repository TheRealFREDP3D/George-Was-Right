# AI Coding Companion Roadmap

## Vision

To create an indispensable AI-powered coding companion that anticipates developer needs, seamlessly integrates with their workflow, and significantly boosts productivity through advanced code generation, intelligent debugging, and proactive assistance.

## Guiding Principles

* **User Experience:** Prioritize intuitive interactions and a frictionless workflow.
* **Integration:** Foster seamless connectivity with popular developer tools and platforms.
* **Gemini API Leverage:**  Harness the power of Gemini for sophisticated code understanding, generation, and analysis.
* **Proactive Assistance:** Anticipate developer needs and provide helpful suggestions before they are explicitly requested.

## Phases

### **Phase 1: Foundation (Estimated Timeline: 2 Months, Priority: High)**

* **Feature:** Enhanced Code Completion (Priority: High)
  * Leverage Gemini API to provide contextually aware code suggestions, including variable names, function calls, and code snippets.
  * Implement intelligent prediction of code completion based on past user behavior and code context.
  * Improve code completion speed and accuracy.
* **Feature:** Basic Code Generation (Priority: Medium)
  * Generate simple code structures (functions, classes, loops) based on natural language descriptions.
  * Utilize Gemini to translate plain English descriptions of desired code functionality into executable code.
* **Feature:** Initial Version Control Integration (Priority: Medium)
  * Integrate with Git for basic commit message suggestions.
  * Basic status display of changes.
* **Metrics:** Track code completion accuracy, code generation success rate, and user satisfaction.

### **Phase 2: Advanced Capabilities (Estimated Timeline: 3 Months, Priority: High)**

* **Feature:** Advanced Code Generation (Priority: High)
  * Generate more complex code structures, including algorithms and data structures.
  * Employ Gemini to analyze codebase and suggest improvements or refactorings.
