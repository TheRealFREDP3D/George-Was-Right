## ✅ GUI Enhancements

#### Summary

The changes made to the GUI significantly improve its functionality and user experience. The introduction of a menu bar, the use of modern widgets like Treeview, and the implementation of threading for execution control are all positive enhancements. However, there are areas for improvement, such as ensuring thread safety for GUI updates and implementing the pause/resume functionality properly.

#### Considerations

- Consider making the window resizable or using relative dimensions to improve usability on different screen sizes.
- Ensure that all GUI updates from threads are done using thread-safe methods like `after()` in Tkinter to avoid potential issues.
- Implement the actual pause and resume functionality in the `pause_execution` method to ensure it affects the analysis process as intended.
- The `save_report` method effectively uses a timestamp in the filename, which is a useful feature for organizing saved reports.

## ✅ Code Structure and Modularity

#### Summary

The refactoring of the code to use an `AgentFactory` and `TaskManager` indicates a more modular and scalable approach to initializing agents and tasks. This is a good practice for maintaining and extending the codebase in the future.

#### Considerations

- The use of `ttk.PanedWindow` and `ttk.LabelFrame` for organizing the layout is commendable and contributes to a clean interface.
- The `initialize_crew` method is well-structured, but ensure that the agent creation logic is thoroughly tested to confirm it behaves as expected.

## ✅ Error Handling and User Feedback

#### Summary

The implementation of error handling in the `run_analysis` method is a good practice for providing user feedback during execution. However, more detailed error handling and logging could enhance the application's robustness.

#### Considerations

- Consider adding more detailed error handling and logging to capture and diagnose issues effectively during execution.
