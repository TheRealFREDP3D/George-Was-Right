The code provided outlines a structure for an application using the CrewAI framework. Here's a breakdown of how the application is structured and its main components:

### Configuration (`Config` Class)

- The `Config` class serves as a central configuration hub for the application, storing constants such as model names and search results.

### External Libraries and Tools

- The code uses several libraries and tools such as `dotenv` for environment variable management and `rich` for enhanced printing capabilities.
- CrewAI framework components are used, including `Agent`, `Task`, `Crew`, and `LLM` classes.
- An instance of `SerperDevTool` is initialized, which is likely used for interacting with a search API.

### AgentFactory Class

- This class is responsible for creating specialized agents. It uses an instance of the `LLM` (likely a language model) to instantiate each agent.

#### Types of Agents

1. **Researcher Agent**: Focuses on providing information related to digital surveillance and social control.
2. **Writer Agent**: Produces comparative analysis articles connecting themes from "1984" to current events.
3. **Illustrator Agent**: Generates conceptual illustration prompts that relate modern surveillance scenarios to "1984".

### TaskManager Class

- This class manages the creation of tasks for the agents. Static method `create_tasks` returns a list of tasks crafted for specific agents.

### Main Function

- Initializes necessary components such as the LLM model and agent factory.
- Creates the agents and assigns them respective tasks using `TaskManager`.
- Initializes a `Crew` object, which coordinates the execution of tasks among agents.
- Executes the crew's tasks and prints a completion message along with the results.

### Execution

- The script is designed to run the `main` function when executed as a standalone script.

Overall, the code's primary objective is to coordinate automated agents that process and analyze data related to George Orwell's "1984," running across tasks such as researching current events, generating narrative articles, and creating visual illustrations.
